# Breast Cancer Predictive Diagnostic

Visualizing and analyzing breast cancer data from the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set][0], provided by University of California Irvine archive.

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. It may be useful to read [this][1] to further understand how the samples were taken and what features in the provided dataset actually represent.

The data is already in a highly usable and clean state so little pre-processing is required but my goals are to:
  1. Further clean and make dataset more usable.
  2. Visualize data in a meaningful and clear way.
  3. Identify attributes that describe the diagnosis most strongly.
  4. Attempt multiple ML techniques to predict the diagnosis.
  5. Choose and explain the most successful ML technique at describe the data.

Tools: Pandas, Matplot lib, and Scikit Learn.
